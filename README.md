# CSCE 378

For our class on interaction design, we created a prototype web-based time-tracking application to use for testing with users and iterating over the course of the semester for learning about UI and UX design.

Although the project is mostly concerned with the interface design and usability, most of the functionality has also been implemented. This includes a basic login, clock-in/out, and daily work history displays.
